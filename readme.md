## Introduction

Simon Says is a classic memory game where the computer generates a sequence of colors, and the player must replicate the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons. As the player successfully replicates the sequence, the game level increases, challenging the player's memory.

## Getting Started

To run the Simon Says Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How to Play

- **Start the Game:** Press any key to start the game.
- **Gameplay:** Observe the sequence of flashing colors and click on the buttons to replicate the sequence.
- **Scoring:** Your score is determined by the level you reach. The highest score is displayed on the screen.
- **Game Over:** If you make a mistake in replicating the sequence, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.

## Code Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. **index.html:** The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, including the game title, highest score display, and colored buttons.

2. **app.js:** The JavaScript file contains the game logic, including the generation of random color sequences, user input handling, and checking for correct sequences.

3. **style.css:** The CSS file provides styling for the HTML elements, creating a visually appealing and responsive layout.
